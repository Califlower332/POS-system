sales page (home)
	database interactions:
		-INSERT purchase, including purchase details
		thats it
		-if we have a separate payment screen, ran by a different page rather than a pop-up, then this page would have NO database interactions.
		instead, it would send the information to the payment page, which would then call the actual database modification function.

admin page
	database interactions: 
		-INSERT product
		-UPDATE product
		-INSERT customer
		-UPDATE customer
		-SELECT purchases
			-WHERE customerID = xxx
			-WHERE DateTime = xxx
		SELECT Purchase Details
			-WHERE PurchaseID = xxx
		-I imagined this would all be accomplished via dropdown menu's that update the page, or pop-up menus. However, each functionality, or groups of functionalities (i.e INSERT and UPDATE products),
		could be offloaded to separate pages. If this is the case then this page would have NO database interactions. It would instead serve as a hub linking you to each of the 
		separate functionalities.
